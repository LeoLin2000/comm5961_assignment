    <div class="main-text">Based on previous user research, there are six stages a user often goes through when planning the trip to a cultural event: <br>
    (1) Find events; (2) Examine events; (3) Decide the event; (4) Plan; (5) Attend the event; (6) Share.<br>
    The website aims at providing users with comprehensive information about cultural events in Xiamen, so that they can find details of the cultural events they are interested in and plan their trips more efficiently. The most important information for users includes basic event information, event reviews, and related merchandise information. Given these core informational objectives, usability testing was conducted to investigate whether the information was helpful for the users, and to what extent the proposed information architecture was clear. The tasks were designed as follows: <br>
    1. Find the details of an exhibition/lecture/workshop/performance (randomly choose one category and ask the participant to find that category)<br>
    2. Find the reviews of a particular event<br>
    3. Find the information about souvenirs/merchandise of a particular event<br> 
    4. Upload a review<br> 
    5. Register and log in<br><br>
