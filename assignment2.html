        <div class="main-text">Living in Fanling, I always feel that there are limited good restaurants around, especially when compared with downtown. However, based on the data on OpenRice, there are actually quite a few good restaurants for people to try in Fanling. To find the best restaurants, I generated a metric called “net sentiment” by calculating the number of likes a restaurant received minus the number of dislikes it received. The above chart shows the top 10 restaurants in Fanling with the highest net sentiment. These restaurants are worth a try if you want to treat yourself to a good meal.</div>

      Which cuisines are most appreciated in Fanling? The second chart on the right displays the top 10 cuisines by net sentiment in Fanling (only cuisines with at least 8 restaurants are taken into account). Sichuan, Western, international and Thai food received the most positive feedback.
